Preparing for a live SQL coding interview involves refreshing your knowledge of SQL syntax, common functions, and the ability to solve problems under time constraints. A cheat sheet can be incredibly handy, as can pre-prepared code templates for complex SQL constructs such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), CASE statements, and window functions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you might want to include:

### SQL Cheat Sheet for Live Coding Interview

**1. Basic SQL Syntax:**
   - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
   - JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS)

**2. Common Functions:**
   - Aggregate Functions: COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX()
   - String Functions: CONCAT(), SUBSTR(), CHAR_LENGTH(), UPPER(), LOWER()
   - Date Functions: CURRENT_DATE, DATE_PART(), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)

**3. Complex Queries:**
   - **Subqueries:** In SELECT, FROM, WHERE
   - **Correlated Subqueries:** EXISTS, NOT EXISTS
   - **Derived Tables:** SELECT ... FROM (SELECT ...) AS subquery

**4. CTEs and Temporary Tables:**
   - CTE Syntax:
     ```sql
     WITH CTE_Name AS (
         SELECT ...
         FROM ...
         WHERE ...
     )
     SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;
     ```
   - Temporary Tables (if supported by the SQL environment):
     ```sql
     CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Temp_Name AS
     SELECT ...
     FROM ...;
     ```

**5. CASE Statements:**
   - Basic CASE:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         CASE 
             WHEN condition1 THEN result1
             WHEN condition2 THEN result2
             ELSE default_result
         END AS new_column
     FROM table_name;
     ```
   - Searched CASE:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         CASE column_name
             WHEN value1 THEN result1
             WHEN value2 THEN result2
             ELSE default_result
         END AS new_column
     FROM table_name;
     ```

**6. Window Functions:**
   - Basic Window Function:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         column_name,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS row_num,
         SUM(column_value) OVER (PARTITION BY another_column) AS cumulative_sum
     FROM table_name;
     ```

**7. Performance and Optimization:**
   - Indexing tips (if applicable)
   - Understanding execution plans
   - Tips for writing efficient SQL queries

### Preparation Tips:
- **Practice:** Use online platforms or datasets to practice writing queries that solve complex problems.
- **Review:** Go over past work or projects to remind yourself of real-world SQL applications.
- **Templates:** Prepare templates for CTEs, window functions, and CASE statements to speed up coding during the interview.
- **Environment Familiarity:** If possible, get familiar with the SQL environment or database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server) you will be using in the interview.

Having these elements in your cheat sheet will help you quickly recall syntax and structure during your interview, making it easier to focus on solving the problem efficiently.
